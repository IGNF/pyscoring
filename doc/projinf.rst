PyScoring
===============
PyScoring is a tool to evaluate the production of vector data by comparing it to an other dataset considered as the ground truth. PyScoring produces metrics qualifying the comparison between the two datasets.
It works with both with 2D (only in .shp) and 3D data (only respecting the CityJSON specifications).

For any question or request don't hesitate to open an issue.
